@magnusburton: Hes got a great voice, but the lyrics are trash. john martin has so much potential, as im sure your aware of hes given us spectrum, save the world, dont you worry child, and fade into darkness, which all became huge because of his vocals. the reload vocals however, are a disapointment, and I believe the song should be left the way it originally came out
It was far better with the Vocals to Save The World and Dont You Worry Child at UMF 
what awesome vocals!!!!!!
Not too impressed
AWESOME !!!!! <3
This vocals suck
Shit job man!
AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGG

best remix of a 15s clip I've heard so far!
Je pensais qu'oser remixer 15 secondes c'etait etre con. Mais ce remix marche vraiment bien. Il respecte le preview, vraiment du bon boulot, juste une remarque, dommage que les vocals avec le vocoder ne soient pas plus poussées, ca aurait été juste parfait, mais vraiment bravo. 
ok so this is fucking ACE

This is why I love the so called 'press play' DJ, that meaningless people seem to categorize Angello as. Still one of the select few artists/producers I could pay over and over again to listen to live, or recorded.

SEÑOR WILLIE COLON, CRECI SIENDO SU FAN, HOY ESTOY AGRADECIDO USTED POR ESTAR TAN PENDIENTE Y PREOCUPADO POR MI PAIS, MIL GRACIAS!!!
Definitivamente que hay un camino diferente, donde exista la verdadera inclusión, que las riquezas del país se reviertan verdaderamente sobre todos y cada uno de los venezolanos para mejorar nuestra calidad de vida y desarrollarnos en todas la areas que nos permita independizarnos de unos pocos que se llenan la boca hablando del pueblo, cuando verdaderamente se promocionan y roban ellos mismos los recursos que producimos levantando la bandera de la libertad y la igualdad, luchemos, votemos y pidamos a nuestro padre creador que se imponga la verdad y la razon en nuestras tierras y en el mundo entero, adelante y Agradecido Willie, vayaaaaaa...
que bueno eres Willi
Graciasssssss
wow!! Willie!! Excelente, muchas gracias por siempre estar pendiente de nuestra Venezuela!
esta buena, pero da tristeza que la realidad de mi país sea cantada y tenga esa letra, es mi Venezuela de la que hablan aquí y todo por una cuerda en enchufados e irresponsables. El tiempo de Dios es perfecto. Pero Igual a Luchar que tenemos mucho por delante, vamos a rescatar este pais, vamos que si se puede!!!! Adelante Venezolanos todos... Juntos podemos lograrlo VOTA
Exelente amigo Willie Colón por tu gran aporte, y a todos los artistas como tu que ponen de su grano de arena para mostrar la realidad de nuestro pais
para q sea serio

Excelente La Pura Verdad... Capriles Presidente y #Hayuncamino #yosoyvenezolano
esto fue lo que le respondi a unos chavista despue de horas dicutiendo y ofendiendonos  Catiuska:Catiuska Moncada Ahora si me voy a poner seria..!! Y les contare algo Tenia una pequena empresa de reposteria y materiales de reposteria en Vnz... no me vine x falta de clientes , contratos o exito sino x la inseguridad extrema y la escasez de materia prima.. la gota que derramó el vaso fue cuando mataron a mi vecino casi en la puerta de mi negocio estando mi hijo mayor .. y gracias a dios mis padres tienen aca una pequena empresa que cumplira 17 anos dentro de poco y ya casi toda mi familia estan aca mi padres todavía le queda uno de los negocios que tenian en Venezuela. No me vine xgusto sino para darle un mejor futuro y calidad de vida a mis hijos , familia.. Y a pesar que gracias a dios me va bien y feliz con casi toda mi familiaa conmigo.. dios me a llenado de muchas bendiciones y alegrias mejor no puedo estar... Pero tambien extraño mucho a mi tierra mis amigos a mi Venezuela bella. De paso estoy muyyy orgullosa de ser Venezolana me duele mucho su destrucción en estos ultimo 14 anos de gobierno ver gente trabajadora ,luchadora chavista y opositora que antes tenian una vida desente y ahora estan en una miseria total. .. en un pais dividido y familias divididas esto jamas se vio en Venezuela x muy copellano que fuesen o muy adecos o izquierdista. Se perdio el respeto incluyéndote a ti xque estabas fajada faltandole el respeto a un escuálido como dicen ustedes. Y mi incluyo tambien yo xque cuando vi eso me dio impotencia y te ataque... veo a ustedes metiéndose en los muros opositores echando peste tambien no lo pienso dos vece y le respondo con mala fe y asi estamos... jamas en la historia venezolana se vio tanta mediocridad ,bajeza y tanta violencia si esto se acabara. Que un candidato llamase Caprile o Maduro eliminara y uniera de VERDAD a los Venezolanos... Esta Historia tendria un final feliz. Ya estamos cansado de eso no me importa un gobierno que robe.. X que La politica es cochina y corrupta siempre se ah visto. Y Venezuela es tan rica que se recupera de eso pero lo que si mi importa es un gobierno que hagan x los ninos, ancianos, enfermos ,incapacitados, y xlos jóvenes. Que le den educación de verdad ,que se acabe los chantajes que si no vas te voto , que una al pueblo ,que no jueguen con la psicología de la gente ignorante, que acabe con la corrupción y los delincuentes que acabe con el hambre las mentiras y la miseria ,que cuando se graduen de medico, abogado etc tengan el futuro asegurado que los Venezolanos sean la prioridad no los Cubanos que pinte de colores a Venezuela la cuiden ...la ultima vez que fui Llore al verla tan acabada y destruida todo lo vi feo como en ruinas... No pueden tapar el sol con un solo dedo ya tienen 14 anos en una sola pelea y recibiendo billones y nada pa Venezuela puro panitos de agua tibia con todo lo que le ah entrado a Venezuela debería estar como una tacita de oro.. mejor que Dubai....!! pienselo. Bye buenas noche Hace 10 horas · Me gusta

El camino está ahora caminemos y cambiemos el panorama , probemos . Flaco a lucirse y nosotros a ayudarte

I keep coming back to this track.  Nice job!
We aint fuckin' playin!
Yes!!!!
Love the bassline
Fucking ill
Dope
Nice rise
Wish i had some henney right now
Damn those bitch niggas
Nice cutaway on the beat... adds drama
Feeling this jam.
I like the grainy sound on the vocals
Really tight integration of the vocals and the track.  The transitions are timed well and the track has good progression.   Very solid!   My only real suggestion is very minor... and thats to put a better title on the track.  I'd at least put your artist name so people know what they are looking at when they see the track in groups and stuff.
This has a nice driving beat...  would love to put this on a workout mix
This is an epic sound!
I love the synth work!
lol  thank guy for the comments i  u  can  download  it
Im gonna start a fuckin' riot if you dont gimme a download of this track!   :)
I think you got a hit here man.  I like the aggressiveness of the vocals.
The vocals are a little too distorted here... i have a little trouble telling what he is saying.  The rap is tight, but maybe turn down the distortion a little?
OOoh,   bro that flow is fresh.
Nice... cant wait to hear more.
Good job guys, this track is dope.  If I can make a suggestion...   use more tags.  You are only using 8, and I think you can have up to 30 per track.  The more tags you use, the easier it will be for people to find you.
This shit is real catchy.   I am feeling your style
Nice dirty south style vocals.
Really feeling this intro.  It sets a nice tone for the song.\
Fuck yea
The main sound in this is the epic part from exogenisis -_- 
Ohhhhh god
Love the piano part!
Very Well Done
fark what a massive drop, this is dope. thanks for having me discovering noisestorm
mmm funky intro dubstep
Love this drop!!!!!
Fuckin huuuge

I thought this was skrillex when I listened. Good stuff
@byutifu: Skrillex didn't invent glitch-vocals, actually... He did, however, make them popular.
biggles and tingles
nice pick up
Yus its finished !
very nice
I heard "I dropped the jam" and I like it
Reupload?

So glad Dubstep.NET finally picked this up uff been followin' eoin for years. Congratz on the recent track success man. You deserve it.
damn good work
like it
that's f*cking hot
nice!
This was able to make it onto Monstercat Media? Man, I remember when someone had to be good to get onto Monstercat........ They really have let themselves go........... Because quite frankly this is rather appalling....
@byutifu: Or.... Take a Skrillex sample and do something with it! Can that be a thing? LETS MAKE IT A THING!!!!!!!!!

ROLLING FACE
@taff-dubstep-jones: You can't possibly say this is better than the Yellow Claw remix..and that came out like a year ago
Wow
Love it!
Why does avicii have to ruin every song I like?
word nasty 
Coool
This is so boring... lol
really don't get why there is so much hate on this just cause its avicii that remixed it, at least he has done something different to his normal stuff!
mad chill
like... a lot
So smoooooooooooov.
this is the first song i've heard that i didnt think was about me that made me wish i was still able to cry
this is bad, all its done is made me listen to the what so not remix again.
vry nice
i agree, definitely trying too hard
Looovvveeeeee
Can u cumpress m8?
Not feeling this remix avicii
He's trying to hard.
F*cking sexy track
FUCK AVICII!
FUCK AVICII!
FUCK AVICII!
FUCK AVICII!
FUCK AVICII!
yeeeeee
@lukaskret: it's the BITCRUSHER plug-in on Logic Pro
not the biggest fan what so not remix is amazing. check it out. 
what
dickie
fuarrrk
TOP!
this is hella gay. wtf.
Kept waiting for it to "happen" but it never did
Avicii's supposed to be hot shit but this is pitiful in comparison to Cry Wolf and Bubbleheads remixea (both much smaller producers)
Gp
kaboom kaboom

Original is da bst
needs more cowbell
alter scheppert das
soo gooooood
Best remix so far and there are some epic remixes
niceer
This the worst excuse for an edit i  have heard! 
HellYeahhh
nice
this is lovely
@ollie-j-1: fully agree
wow nice intro 
@minimz: It's just an edit - not even a remix. Usually edits are just small adjustments to make a track more compatible to your own style in your sets. 14,000 plays and 800 likes in a day is pretty good support if you ask me.
I'm not feelin this.
this is weak
Avicii switching it up!
Such a guru!
Avicii is getting so diverse 
GREAT ORIGINAL!!!!  BAD EDIT.
meh
Tim on the come up? Ha, dope sounds
Love love this song. Great mix.
w000 aviciiiiiii
Sick edit! Clearly the best one after the original mix!
I'm sry, but I think this edit is really lame
Crap! Andy c remix is the best, avicii totally over rated 
radical mate
so cool! thx for download ;)
very poor edit
Avicii fucking suuuucks
solid!
No faults, perfect <3
Where did u get that kick?!?!? Love all of the pieces u guys put together for this tune!!!
Fantastic
poor edit
Considering how much support this track has, it's hard to think this guy is so famous he has his own hotel
avicii is king. fuck the haters
woudlve been so much better a different type of clap :(
Ata boy Tim!
does not sound like Avicii at all... but i like it :D
Fuck avicii
PEW PEW
Ewwww what the fuck is this right now?
thank you guys for the download
HAH Lazy My Ass! ^_^
feels like a lazy remix
nice edit :]
Beautiful!
great!

@noobleh: Cheers!
I almost never listen to mixsets, but I always tune in to yours because they've got a theme and aren't just the latest blog-hits stitched together. It's got mood; and while that might not be the most efficient way to grab followers or maximize show turnout in a commercial sense, it sets you apart as someone who feels the must and will be around in 10 years (and not a flash).
hey , nice
Awesome Mix mate!
This mix is great, but for those of us with no Facebook, no download :'(
